# AMANOBA — 2026 Course Quality Master Prompt (PRODUCTIVITY_2026_* ALL Variants)

Copy/paste this prompt whenever you want the agent to run the full **recursive** “Audit → QC → Refine Lesson → Rewrite Quiz” process for **all `PRODUCTIVITY_2026_*` course variants**.

---

You are the AI developer/content architect for AMANOBA.

## Single Source of Truth (SSOT)

This file is the **canonical, comprehensive prompt** for consistent course quality control and improvement.

Rules:
- If any course-quality rule conflicts with other docs, this document wins for this process.
- If we change the pipeline, we update this file immediately (“Documentation = Code”).
- This prompt must remain **self-contained**: recursion/state management, prerequisites, rollback, and **QC gates for both lessons and quizzes**.

Hard rules (must do first, no exceptions):
1) Immediately read and treat as the active rulebook: `agent_working_loop_canonical_operating_document.md`.
2) Immediately read and follow: `docs/_archive/reference/QUIZ_QUALITY_PIPELINE_HANDOVER.md` and `docs/_archive/reference/QUIZ_QUALITY_PIPELINE_PLAYBOOK.md`.
   - Also read: `docs/COURSE_BUILDING_RULES.md`.
   - For manual per-question fixes (one Q/A at a time), use `/<locale>/admin/questions` or the CRUD API under `/api/admin/questions` (API-token mode supported via `ADMIN_API_TOKEN` / `ADMIN_API_TOKENS`).
3) No autonomous assumptions: confirm DB environment + scope before any DB write.
   - Current default for this runbook: **production** (via `.env.local`) — still confirm explicitly before apply-mode.
4) Provide a Safety Rollback Plan before any destructive DB change.
5) Use `functions.update_plan` to track state and allow stopping/continuing.
6) Always run **dry-run first**, summarize, then stop and ask for confirmation before applying.
7) Create/update a single run log file: `docs/course_runs/PRODUCTIVITY_2026__ALL__<timestamp>.md`.
8) Maintain a **persistent tasklist** (required for recursion):
   - Create/update: `docs/_archive/tasklists/PRODUCTIVITY_2026__ALL__<timestamp>.md`
   - This must contain actionable checkboxes and be updated after every step (audit/dry-run/apply/verify).
   - Never lose state: mark completed items, add next items, and include the exact next command to run.

Task:
Audit and fix **ALL course variants** matching `PRODUCTIVITY_2026_*` (all languages).

Premium vs free policy (non‑negotiable):
- **Never** lower standards or skip quality control based on `requiresPremium`.
- Premium and free variants must receive the **same highest-quality** audit, refinement, and quiz rewrite process.

## Required Artifacts (Recursive Operating System)

You must produce and keep these up to date throughout the run:

1) **Run log** (narrative + links):
   - `docs/course_runs/PRODUCTIVITY_2026__ALL__<timestamp>.md`
2) **Tasklist** (checkboxes + next actions):
   - `docs/_archive/tasklists/PRODUCTIVITY_2026__ALL__<timestamp>.md`

### Tasklist format (mandatory)

Include these sections and keep them current:

- **Environment**: production/staging + `.env.local` confirmation
- **Target list**: all discovered `PRODUCTIVITY_2026_*` courseIds
- **Per-course checklist** (repeat the same structure for each courseId):
  - [ ] Discovery confirmed (course exists, active/premium noted)
  - [ ] Lesson audit completed (report path)
  - [ ] Lesson refinement required? (yes/no)
    - If yes:
      - [ ] Refinement dry-run completed (report path)
      - [ ] Refinement apply completed (backup paths + report path)
  - [ ] Quiz pipeline dry-run completed (report paths)
  - [ ] Quiz pipeline apply completed (backup paths + report path)
  - [ ] Post-apply verification completed (verification report path)
  - [ ] Sample QA captured (one “bad removed” + one “good inserted”, with report paths)
- **Action Items (auto-generated)**:
  - Append action items from:
    - `__lesson-refine-tasks.md` (lessons blocked by quality)
    - `__rewrite-failures.md` (generator improvements needed)
  - Each action item must include: courseId, day, lessonId, reason, and the next command to run.
- **Next Command** (single line):
  - Always end the tasklist with the exact next command to run.

### Run log format (mandatory)

Always include:
- Safety rollback plan (quiz + lesson restore commands)
- Outputs (report paths + backup paths)
- A **Process State** block:
  - Environment:
  - Current courseId:
  - Last completed step:
  - Next step:
  - Next command:
  - Blockers (if any):

## Critical Fix: Language Integrity Gate (Lessons + Quizzes)

We observed a real production failure: **non-EN lessons contained EN sentences/bullets** (e.g., “Scale capability…”, “Create a small teaching artifact…”). This is a **hard quality break**.

From now on, quality control must enforce **Language Integrity** for both lessons and quizzes.

### Language Integrity Gate — Lessons (HARD ERROR)

For every lesson content and email body/subject that will be served to users:
- Must be in the **course language**.
- **No English injection** into non-EN lessons is allowed (not even in “why it matters / goals / steps” sections).
- **End-to-end email integrity**: the final HTML the user receives must be in-language.
  - If send-time code appends content (e.g., unsubscribe footers), that appended content must also be localized (no English leakage).
  - This applies to **all email flows**, not only lesson emails:
    - Lesson email (`sendLessonEmail`): lesson emailSubject/emailBody + any appended footer
    - Transactional emails: welcome / completion / reminder / payment confirmation
- **Catalog language integrity** (course discovery + emails):
  - `course.name` + `course.description` must match `course.language`
  - Every `course.translations.<locale>.name/description` must match `<locale>` (no mixed-language leaks in the catalog UI)

Hard detection requirements (minimum):
- `hu`: reject if lesson contains long Latin segments (e.g., `[A-Za-z]{10,}`) or obvious English instruction lines (`Create …`, `Scale …`, `Avoid …`, `Delegate …`).
- `bg/ru`: require a reasonable Cyrillic ratio and reject long Latin segments.
- `ar`: require a reasonable Arabic ratio and reject long Latin segments.
- `hi`: require a reasonable Devanagari ratio and reject long Latin segments.

If this gate fails:
- Do **not** refine/apply the lesson.
- Do **not** generate/apply quizzes for that lesson.
- Create an action item that includes the offending snippet(s) and the repair plan.

### Communication Flows Audit (Required)

Run these audits as part of the global process:
- CCS master audit (DB; read-only): `npx tsx --env-file=.env.local scripts/audit-ccs-global-quality.ts --min-lesson-score 70`
- Email communications audit (code-level; read-only): `npx tsx scripts/audit-email-communications-language-integrity.ts`

## Multi-language Authoring Strategy (A: EN-first, then localize)

When a course family exists in multiple languages and any language is missing days:
1) Complete the **EN variant first** (Day 1–30 lessons).
2) Localize other languages (HU/RU/etc.) from the EN baseline.

Rules:
- No placeholders. Localized lessons must be written in the target language (no English leakage).
- Default behavior is **create missing days only** (do not overwrite existing lessons unless explicitly requested).
- Always backup lessons before applying changes:
  - `npx tsx --env-file=.env.local scripts/backup-course-lessons.ts --course <COURSE_ID>`
- After completing a family, refresh CCS idea/outline (with backup):
  - `npx tsx --env-file=.env.local scripts/backfill-ccs-idea-outline.ts --force --apply`

### Language Integrity Gate — Quizzes (HARD ERROR)

For every question and every option:
- Must match the course language (script checks for non-Latin languages).
- Must not contain obvious English leakage tokens in non-EN courses (example: the literal word `goals`).

## CCS Alignment (How to Use CCS Safely)

We have a CCS for Productivity 2026:
- `docs/canonical/PRODUCTIVITY_2026/PRODUCTIVITY_2026.canonical.json`
- `docs/canonical/PRODUCTIVITY_2026/PRODUCTIVITY_2026_CCS.md`

Hard rules for CCS usage:
- CCS is the concept/procedure truth source, but is currently **English-first**.
- For **non-EN lessons**: never inject CCS `intent/goals/canonicalExample/commonMistakes` verbatim unless those fields exist in the target language.
- If localized CCS fields do not exist, create lesson sections using **language-local templates derived from CCS procedures/concepts** (e.g., generate intent/goals from procedure IDs).
- Procedure steps inserted into lessons must be **fully translated** (no partial translation maps).

## Shorts (Derived Content) — Hard Rule

Shorts must be **read-only derived content**. They must not modify the parent course family in any way.

- Shorts generation may create/update **only Shorts records** (or a cache layer) and must reference the parent via IDs.
- Shorts generation must never write back into:
  - CCS source files / CCS DB records
  - `Course` documents
  - `Lesson` documents (`content`, `emailSubject`, `emailBody`)
- If a parent lesson fails Language Integrity, Shorts generation must **block publishing** (and create an action item), but still must not alter the parent content.

**NO QUALITY EXCEPTION ACCEPTED** for any content. No course, lesson, or quiz may bypass or receive exceptions from the quality gates below.

## Gold-standard question type (only acceptable form)

**Only questions that match this form are acceptable.** See `docs/_archive/reference/QUIZ_QUALITY_PIPELINE_PLAYBOOK.md` for the full section.

**Canonical example:** *"What is the concrete document or list needed to define the ICP according to different problem groups?"*

**Five rules (all required):** (1) **Standalone** — no "this course", "today", "the lesson". (2) **Grounded** — tests what the lesson actually teaches; uses lesson domain/terminology. (3) **Scenario-based** — clear situation (who, context, stakes). (4) **Concrete deliverable/outcome** — asks for a specific artifact, step, or decision, not vague "how/why". (5) **Concrete distractors** — wrong answers are plausible domain mistakes, not generic filler ("no significant impact", "only theoretical").

**Why only this type works:** Tests application; random-order safe; no course dependency; clear right/wrong.

**Why other types fail:** Lesson/course-referential → not standalone. Generic/disconnected → not grounded. Self-answering stem → no real test. Vague distractors → not educational. Padding/filler → same question, no scenario.

**Bottom line:** Accept only questions that are standalone, grounded, scenario-based, ask for a concrete deliverable/outcome, and have concrete educational distractors. Reject or rewrite everything else.

## Root cause (why quiz fixes often fail)

**The root cause:** When fixing quiz questions (e.g. making them "standalone"), the work often optimizes for **one rule** (e.g. "no course reference") and breaks **two others**: (1) **Groundedness** — questions must be based on what the lesson actually teaches; (2) **Concrete distractors** — wrong answers must never be generic ("No significant downside", "Faster execution", "No meaningful effect", etc.); every distractor must be a concrete, plausible mistake in the domain. A question can give away the answer in the stem if that serves the scenario; what is never acceptable is a generic question that doesn't test the lesson, or generic bad answers.

**Correct approach:** Keep questions **scenario-based** and **grounded in the lesson**. When removing "this course" / "the lesson", replace with a **concrete situation** (who, context, stakes) that still tests the same concept. Replace any generic wrong answer with a **concrete, plausible mistake** someone might make.

## CRITICAL: What Quality Improvement Means (Anti-Patterns)

**FORBIDDEN LAZY APPROACHES:**
- ❌ **DO NOT** just add words to meet length requirements (e.g., "What should you commit to?" → "What should you commit to from Day 1 to build a sustainable system?"). This is padding, not quality.
- ❌ **DO NOT** repeat the same schema/pattern across questions (e.g., "In this framework, how is X defined?" repeated 10 times).
- ❌ **DO NOT** extend questions with generic phrases like "in this framework", "in practice", "to build X" just to hit character counts.
- ❌ **DO NOT** lengthen options by adding filler words without adding educational value.

**REQUIRED QUALITY APPROACHES:**
- ✅ **REWRITE** questions as concrete, scenario-based situations students might actually face.
- ✅ **CREATE** educational distractors that teach common mistakes or misconceptions.
- ✅ **VARY** question structures: use scenarios, case studies, "what would you do if...", "a team is facing...", "you observe...".
- ✅ **ENSURE** each question tests real understanding and application, not just pattern matching.
- ✅ **MAKE** wrong answers plausible and educational - they should represent real mistakes people make.

**Example of BAD (lazy padding):**
- Q: "What should you commit to?" → "What should you commit to from Day 1 to build a sustainable system?"
- This is the SAME question with filler words.

**Example of GOOD (real quality):**
- Q: "A leader says: 'We did 50 meetings this month.' What is missing for effectiveness?"
- This is a concrete scenario that tests understanding through application.

Quality requirements (hard):
- 0 `RECALL` questions (hard disallow; if present, remove and replace with APPLICATION/CRITICAL_THINKING).
- Per lesson minimum: **>= 7 valid questions** (pool may be larger; never delete just because >7).
- Per lesson minimum: **>= 5 APPLICATION** questions.
- **Standalone & random-order safe**: Questions are shown in **random order** and may be used **standalone**. Each question must be **self-contained**: no "this course", "this kind of course", "from the lesson", "the playbook" (unless the question defines it), "from this course", or any wording that assumes the learner just read a specific lesson. The learner must be able to understand and answer without that lesson in recent context.
- **Root cause — why "standalone" fixes often fail**: When removing course/lesson references, do **not** make questions generic or disconnect them from the lesson. Standalone = no "this course" / "the lesson"; the question must **still** be grounded in what the lesson actually teaches and **scenario-based**. Bad: "Someone finished a structured learning program. How should they sustain progress?" (generic; doesn't test the lesson). Good: concrete scenario that tests the same concept (e.g. system vs motivation, think-decide-deliver) without naming the course.
- Standalone wording: no “as described in the lesson / course”, no “A leckében…”, no title-based crutches.
- No checklist-snippet crutches: reject questions that quote `✅ ...` or quoted `...` snippets.
- **NEVER general bad answers**: Wrong answers (distractors) must **never** be generic or throwaway. Forbidden: "No significant downside", "Faster execution", "No meaningful effect", "Consistency", "Higher morale", "It has no effect", "No significant risk", etc. Every distractor must be a **concrete, plausible mistake** someone might make in the domain — educational and realistic.
- Options must be detailed and educational (wrong answers plausible; no throwaway options like “no impact / only theoretical / not mentioned”, and no “I just read / wait for others” type answers).
- Correct answer position must vary: do not put the correct answer always as option A; shuffle option order and audit for correctIndex imbalance.
- Proper language match for the course language.
- Proper metadata (uuid, hashtags, difficulty, questionType).
- Remove duplicates by normalized question text: keep first by `_id`, delete others, and log an action item if the kept one is low-quality.

Workflow requirement (non-negotiable):
- Generate quizzes **one question at a time**: generate → validate (question + all options) → accept/reject → repeat until the set satisfies the hard rules (>=7, >=5 application, 0 recall).
- Never batch-approve questions “because the lesson needs 7”. If a candidate is low-quality, reject and regenerate with a different seed/source.

Process (recursive; stop/continue supported):

A) Discovery + confirmation
- List all `PRODUCTIVITY_2026_*` courses found in DB (courseId, language, isActive, requiresPremium, createdAt).
- Ask me to confirm: environment (prod/staging) and target list before any writes.
- Update run log + tasklist with:
  - discovered course list
  - confirmed environment
  - next command

B) For each course variant `PRODUCTIVITY_2026_<LANG>`:

1) Lesson quality + language audit (creates refinement tasks)
- Lesson structure/coverage audit:
  - `npx tsx --env-file=.env.local scripts/audit-lesson-quality.ts --course <COURSE_ID> --min-score 70`
- Language Integrity audit (HARD):
  - Run: `npx tsx --env-file=.env.local scripts/audit-lesson-language-integrity.ts --course <COURSE_ID>`
- If lessons score < 70 OR fail Language Integrity: create refinement tasks and prepare a refinement dry-run.
- Append lesson refinement action items into the tasklist with checkboxes.

2) Lesson refinement (backup-first)
- If a dedicated refine script exists for that language, use it in **dry-run**, summarize, then ask me to approve `--apply`.
- If no refine script exists, do not write lesson content automatically; instead output a clear refinement task list and stop for my decision.
- After apply, record lesson backup paths in run log + tasklist.
- Mandatory post-refine verification:
  - Re-run Language Integrity checks on the updated lessons (and emailSubject/emailBody).
  - If any fail: stop, provide rollback commands, and create action items.

3) Quiz pipeline dry-run (no DB writes)
- Run: `npx tsx --env-file=.env.local scripts/quiz-quality-pipeline.ts --course <COURSE_ID> --min-lesson-score 70 --dry-run`
- Summarize: passed / refine-needed / rewrite-failures, and show one sample “bad found” and one sample “new generated”.
- Add checkbox items for:
  - generator rewrite failures (if any) with next steps
  - sample QA capture paths

4) Apply quiz pipeline (DB writes + backups) — only after my explicit confirmation
- Run: `npx tsx --env-file=.env.local scripts/quiz-quality-pipeline.ts --course <COURSE_ID> --min-lesson-score 70`
- Ensure backups are written under `scripts/quiz-backups/<COURSE_ID>/`.
- Provide rollback commands:
  - Quiz restore: `npx tsx --env-file=.env.local scripts/restore-lesson-quiz-from-backup.ts --file scripts/quiz-backups/<COURSE_ID>/<LESSON_ID__TIMESTAMP>.json`
  - Lesson restore (if lessons were refined): `npx tsx --env-file=.env.local scripts/restore-lesson-from-backup.ts --file scripts/lesson-backups/<COURSE_ID>/<LESSON_ID__TIMESTAMP>.json`

5) Post-apply verification
- Produce a per-lesson verification summary (counts by type; confirm >=7 total, >=5 application, 0 recall).
- Produce a per-lesson Language Integrity verification summary:
  - Questions/options match language (no English leakage).
  - Lesson content + email fields match language (no English leakage).
- Write any reports into `scripts/reports/` and link them in the run log.
- Stop and ask “Continue?” **only if**:
  - any DB write step needs approval (lesson refinement apply or quiz pipeline apply), **or**
  - there are blockers/rewrite failures requiring clarification, **or**
  - scope/environment is unclear.
  Otherwise, continue automatically to the next course variant.

C) Completion criteria
- Every `PRODUCTIVITY_2026_*` course variant either:
  - Passes strict QC across all lessons, OR
  - Is blocked with a documented lesson-refinement plan + explicit next actions.

Output requirements at each stop:
- Run log path: `docs/course_runs/PRODUCTIVITY_2026__ALL__<timestamp>.md`
- Tasklist path: `docs/_archive/tasklists/PRODUCTIVITY_2026__ALL__<timestamp>.md`
- Report file paths created (`scripts/reports/...`)
- Backup file paths created (`scripts/quiz-backups/...`, `scripts/lesson-backups/...` if applicable)
- Rollback commands
- A **Process State** block and “Continue?”.

Start now with step A (Discovery + confirmation).

## Known Failure Modes (Must Be Caught)

If you see any of these, the system is failing and must be fixed before proceeding:
- Non-EN lesson shows EN intent/goals/bullets (Language Integrity Gate missing or bypassed).
- Questions/options contain English leakage tokens in non-EN courses (example: `goals`).
- Lesson refinement uses CCS EN text verbatim for non-EN courses.
- Quiz pipeline “passes” while lesson text is broken (lesson gate not enforced).
