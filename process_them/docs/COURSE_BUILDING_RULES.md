# Unified Course Building Rules

**Date**: 2026-01-24  
**Status**: ✅ ACTIVE  
**Version**: 1.0

---

## Overview

This document defines the standardized process for creating and delivering courses on the Amanoba platform. All course creation must follow these rules to ensure quality, consistency, and proper localization.

### Platform defaults (required unless explicitly overridden)
1) **Environment default**: production via `.env.local`, writing to MongoDB Atlas database **`amanoba`**.
2) **Course format default**: always create a **30-day parent course** first.
3) **Commercial default**: default is **free** (`requiresPremium: false`).
4) **Assessment default**: quizzes are required and must pass SSOT gates (>=7 valid, >=5 application, 0 recall) and language integrity.

## Pre-Development Checklist

### 1. Language Requirements Check

**Before starting course creation:**

1. **Identify requested languages** - Check what languages the course should be delivered in
2. **Check UI translation status** - Verify if translation files exist in `messages/` folder
3. **Plan translation delivery** - If new languages appear without UI translations:
   - **PREREQUISITE**: UI translations MUST be delivered BEFORE the first lesson
   - Create translation files for all missing languages
   - Ensure all UI strings are translated (buttons, labels, navigation, etc.)
   - Test UI in target language to ensure no missing keys

**Current UI translation status:**
- ✅ Hungarian (`hu`) - Complete
- ✅ English (`en`) - Complete
- ❌ Turkish (`tr`) - Missing
- ❌ Bulgarian (`bg`) - Missing
- ❌ Polish (`pl`) - Missing
- ❌ Vietnamese (`vi`) - Missing
- ❌ Indonesian (`id`) - Missing
- ❌ Arabic (`ar`) - Missing
- ❌ Brazilian Portuguese (`pt-BR` or `pt`) - Missing
- ❌ Hindi (`hi`) - Missing

**Action**: For any missing language, create `messages/{locale}.json` file with complete translations before course delivery.

---

### 2. Content Similarity Check

**Before creating new course:**

1. **Search existing courses** - Check database and course documentation for similar content
2. **Review lesson plans** - If similar courses exist, review their lesson structure
3. **Identify reusable content** - Check if any lessons from existing courses can be:
   - Directly reused (if content matches)
   - Adapted/modified (if similar but needs customization)
   - Referenced (if concepts overlap)

**Benefits:**
- Avoid duplicate content creation
- Maintain consistency across courses
- Leverage existing high-quality content
- Faster course delivery

**Example**: If creating a "Productivity Basics" course and "Time Management 101" exists, check if Day 1-5 lessons can be adapted.

---

### 3. Course Structure & Audience Analysis

**Before writing content, ensure you have:**

1. **Clear course structure** - 30-day plan with daily lessons (20-30 min each)
2. **Target audience defined** - Who is this course for?
   - Solo operators
   - Product teams
   - Sales teams
   - Mixed audience
3. **Knowledge level** - Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced
4. **Learning objectives** - What will students learn/achieve?
5. **Prerequisites** - What knowledge is assumed?

**If information is missing:**
- Request clarification from stakeholder
- Make reasonable assumptions and document them
- Create a course outline/proposal for approval

---

### 4. Source Material Preparation

**Prepare ALL sources, not just what you use:**

1. **Primary sources** - Books, articles, research papers used for content
2. **Reference materials** - Additional resources for deeper learning
3. **Student resources** - Materials to share with students:
   - Templates
   - Checklists
   - Worksheets
   - External links
   - Recommended reading
   - Tools/apps to use

**Document all sources:**
- Create a "Sources & Resources" section in course documentation
- Include citations where appropriate
- Provide links to external resources
- Note which sources were used for which lessons

---

## Course Delivery Process

### Step 1: Create Course & Language Variants

**For each language:**

1. **Create course record** via API or seed script:
   ```typescript
   {
     courseId: 'PRODUCTIVITY_2026', // Uppercase, alphanumeric + underscores
     name: 'Course Name in Target Language',
     description: 'Course description in target language',
     language: 'hu', // Language code (hu, en, tr, bg, pl, vi, id, ar, pt, hi)
     durationDays: 30,
     isActive: false, // Start as draft
     requiresPremium: false, // Or true if premium
     pointsConfig: {
       completionPoints: 1000,
       lessonPoints: 50,
       perfectCourseBonus: 500
     },
     xpConfig: {
       completionXP: 500,
       lessonXP: 25
     },
     metadata: {
       category: 'productivity',
       difficulty: 'intermediate',
       estimatedHours: 10,
       tags: ['productivity', 'time-management'],
       instructor: 'Amanoba'
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Create separate course record for each language** - Each language gets its own course document
3. **Link via courseId pattern** - Use `PRODUCTIVITY_2026_HU`, `PRODUCTIVITY_2026_EN`, etc., or use translations field

**Seed scripts — database requirement:**  
The app connects to MongoDB with `dbName: process.env.DB_NAME || 'amanoba'` (see `app/lib/mongodb.ts`). Any seed script that creates courses, CCS, lessons, or quiz questions **must** use the same database when connecting, e.g. `mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGODB_URI, { dbName: process.env.DB_NAME || 'amanoba' })`. Otherwise data is written to the default DB (e.g. `test`) and will not appear in the app or admin. Reference: `scripts/seed-playbook-design-2026-en.ts`, `scripts/seed-done-better-2026-en.ts`, and `docs/course_runs/DONE_BETTER_2026_EN__2026-01-28.md`.

### Step 2: Create First Lesson & Quiz

**NO QUALITY EXCEPTION ACCEPTED** for any content. No course, lesson, or quiz may bypass or receive exceptions from the quality gates below.

**Quality Standards:**

#### Lesson Content:
- ✅ **High quality** - Well-researched, accurate, valuable
- ✅ **Avoid bullshitting** - No fluff, no generic platitudes
- ✅ **Avoid too general content** - Be specific, actionable, practical
- ✅ **Deliver VALUE** - Students should learn something concrete and applicable
- ✅ **20-30 minute reading time** - Appropriate length for daily lesson
- ✅ **Clear structure** - Introduction, main content, summary, action items

#### Quiz Questions (MANDATORY QUALITY STANDARDS):

**Gold standard (only acceptable form):** Every question must be standalone, grounded in the lesson, scenario-based, ask for a concrete deliverable/outcome, and use concrete educational distractors. See `docs/_archive/reference/QUIZ_QUALITY_PIPELINE_PLAYBOOK.md` for the canonical example and "why other types fail."

- ✅ **Minimum 7 questions per quiz** - can be **more** than 7 (never delete valid questions just to cap)
- ✅ **100% related to lesson content** - Every question must test actual lesson material
- ✅ **Same language as course** - 100% language consistency, no mixing, no fallbacks
- ✅ **Native quality** - Professional, native-level writing, not machine translation
- ✅ **Proper industry jargon** - Keep industry terms in appropriate language
- ✅ **Educational value** - Questions teach, not just test. All answers are educational
- ✅ **No stupid answers** - Wrong options are plausible and educational (teach common mistakes)
- ✅ **Standalone questions** - Each question works independently, no references to other questions
- ✅ **Test understanding** - Questions verify comprehension and application, not just memorization
- ✅ **Clear, unambiguous** - No confusing wording, no trick questions
- ✅ **4 answer options** - Exactly 4 options (1 correct + 3 plausible distractors)
- ✅ **Proper metadata** - Every question must have:
  - UUID v4 (unique identifier)
  - Hashtags: `[#topic, #difficulty, #type, #language, #all-languages]`
  - questionType: `RECALL`, `APPLICATION`, or `CRITICAL_THINKING`
  - difficulty: `EASY`, `MEDIUM`, `HARD`, or `EXPERT`
  - category: Valid English enum value (not translated)

**Quiz Structure (MANDATORY):**
- **Minimum 7 questions** - can be **more** than 7 (do not delete valid questions just to cap at 7)
- **Cognitive mix** (MANDATORY - STRICT RULES):
  - **0 questions: RECALL** - NO recall questions allowed (hard rule)
  - **At least 5 questions: APPLICATION** - Minimum 5 application questions (hard rule)
  - **At least 2 questions: CRITICAL_THINKING** - Recommended minimum 2 critical thinking questions (warning if less)
- **Question Quality Requirements**:
  - Minimum 40 characters per question
  - Minimum 25 characters per answer option
  - No generic template patterns (e.g., "What is a key concept from...", "Mit jelent a...")
  - No fragmented terms in quotes (e.g., "mestere" without context)
  - All questions must be 100% related to actual lesson content
  - All answers must have educational value (no "stupid" answers)
- **Pass threshold**: 70% (configurable per course)
- **Question types**: Multiple choice only (for now)
- **Language**: 100% same as course language, no fallbacks

#### Language Integrity (LESSONS + QUIZZES) — HARD GATE

We must prevent mixed-language lessons/quizzes.

- **Lesson content + emailSubject/emailBody** must match the course language.
- **Quiz question + all options** must match the course language.
- No English leakage into non-EN content (e.g., English “why it matters” sentences, bullet steps, or the literal token `goals`).

If Language Integrity fails:
- Block apply-mode changes for that lesson.
- Create an action item to localize/repair (do not “ship anyway”).

### Step 3: Translation Quality Standards

**Translation Requirements:**

1. **High quality translation** - Professional, native-level quality
2. **Industry jargon handling**:
   - **IT terms** → Keep in English (e.g., "API", "SaaS", "Kanban")
   - **Medical terms** → Keep in Latin/English (e.g., "diagnosis", "symptom")
   - **Business terms** → Keep in English if commonly used (e.g., "OKR", "KPI", "ROI")
   - **Technical terms** → Keep in original language if industry standard
3. **Natural translation** - Translate like a human, not a machine:
   - ✅ Easy to read
   - ✅ Easy to understand
   - ✅ Localized (cultural context, examples)
   - ✅ Native writer quality
   - ❌ NOT like a foreigner trying to write in that language
   - ❌ NOT literal word-for-word translation
   - ❌ NOT machine-translation style

**Translation Process:**
1. Translate main content naturally
2. Keep industry terms in original language
3. Localize examples and cultural references
4. Review for readability and flow
5. Ensure technical accuracy is maintained

## Example: Course Creation Script Structure

```typescript
// 1. Create courses for all languages
const languages = ['hu', 'en', 'ru', 'tr', 'bg', 'pl', 'vi', 'id', 'ar', 'pt', 'hi'];

for (const lang of languages) {
  const course = await Course.create({
    courseId: `PRODUCTIVITY_2026_${lang.toUpperCase()}`,
    name: getCourseName(lang), // Translated name
    description: getCourseDescription(lang), // Translated description
    language: lang,
    // ... other fields
  });
  
  // 2. Create Lesson 1
  const lesson = await Lesson.create({
    courseId: course._id,
    lessonId: `${course.courseId}_DAY_01`,
    dayNumber: 1,
    title: getLessonTitle(lang),
    content: getLessonContent(lang), // High quality, translated
    // ... other fields
  });
  
  // 3. Create Quiz 1
  const questions = getQuizQuestions(lang); // 5-10 questions, translated
  for (const q of questions) {
    await QuizQuestion.create({
      lessonId: lesson.lessonId,
      courseId: course.courseId,
      // ... question data
    });
  }
}
```
