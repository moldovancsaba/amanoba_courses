---

## 🔍 Quality Standards

### Grammar & Language
- ✅ Zero grammatical errors
- ✅ Correct spelling (language-specific)
- ✅ Proper punctuation
- ✅ Consistent terminology
- ✅ Subject-verb agreement (e.g., "Nincsenek számok" not "Nincs számok")

### Tone & Style (MANDATORY STANDARDS)
- ✅ **Conversational Engagement**: Write as if talking directly to a friend/colleague. Use "you" and "I" for immediate connection
- ✅ **Active Voice**: Always favor active voice ("The developer fixed the bug") over passive ("The bug was fixed")
- ✅ **Plain Language**: Avoid academic jargon but keep industry standard phrases. Replace complex words with simpler alternatives
- ✅ **Frontloading (Inverted Pyramid)**: Put critical information and WIIFM (What's In It For Me) first. Skimmers should grasp main point in first few seconds
- ✅ **Microlearning (Chunking)**: Break into 5-10 minute bite-sized modules, each with single performance-based objective
- ✅ **Modular Self-Containment**: Structure paragraphs to stand alone. Learners can jump to needed info without reading preceding sections
- ✅ **Bulleted and Numbered Lists**: Use lists to break up "walls of text." Numbered for sequences, bullets for non-hierarchical items
- ✅ **Descriptive Subheadings**: Headings that tell what they'll learn ("How to Set Up Your Dashboard") not vague titles ("Introduction")
- ✅ **Action Verbs**: Use strong action verbs ("Analyze," "Construct," "Solve") in learning objectives
- ✅ **Problem-Based Learning**: Start with scenario/question that activates prior knowledge
- ✅ **Show, Don't Just Tell**: Use real-world examples, analogies, brief storytelling to make abstract concepts concrete

### Logic & Structure
- ✅ Coherent flow of ideas
- ✅ Logical progression
- ✅ No contradictions within or between lessons
- ✅ Clear learning objectives
- ✅ Proper section organization

### Fact-Checking (COMPREHENSIVE)
- ✅ Accurate technical information
- ✅ Up-to-date references (no outdated URLs, dates, or facts)
- ✅ Correct version numbers (if applicable)
- ✅ Valid external links
- ✅ Current best practices
- ✅ **Outdated Facts & Dates**: Update to fresh information. For information that could become outdated, add date when it was true (e.g., "As of January 2026, Shopify API v2024-01 supports...")
- ✅ Verify all technical claims
- ✅ Check all external resources are still accessible

### Content Quality
- ✅ Educational value
- ✅ Actionable insights
- ✅ Clear examples
- ✅ Practical exercises
- ✅ Respectful of learner's time
